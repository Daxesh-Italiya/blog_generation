Follow E-E-A-T guidelines (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
Integrate secondary keywords naturally
Add statistics with proper hyperlinks to the source
Include expert quotes and real-world examples
Ensure content addresses user intent
Insert internal links where relevant.
Keyword density needs to be 0.8-1.2%. Per 1000 words article, the ideal keyword must be around 8-10 & Maximum 12, not more than that.

Tone & Style

Use active voice → “We build apps” (not “Apps are built by us”).
Keep it conversational → write like you’re talking to a friend.
Add small human touches → “That’s where it gets interesting…” or “Here’s the catch.”
Use contractions (I’m, you’re, we’ve) for natural flow.

Word Choice
Prefer simple words: use “use” not “utilize,” “help” not “facilitate.”
Avoid jargon unless necessary; explain it when used.
Keep sentences 15–20 words max. Mix short + medium-length sentences for rhythm.

Formatting & Readability
Break long text into short paragraphs (3–5 sentences max each).
Use headings, bullet points, and bold highlights for scannability.
Place important info early in each section.

SEO + Human Balance
Naturally insert keywords → don’t force them.
Use keywords in headings and the first 100 words if natural.
Focus on user intent → answer what the reader came looking for.
Always write for humans first, search engines second.
