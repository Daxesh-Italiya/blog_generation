## For Section: H2: Best Practices for Log Analysis
Title: Effective Log Analysis Strategies

Key Points:
*   **Centralize Logs:** Aggregate logs from all sources into a single platform for comprehensive visibility.
*   **Establish Baselines:** Understand normal system behavior to quickly identify anomalies.
*   **Automate Alerting:** Set up automated alerts for critical events and deviations from baselines.
*   **Regular Review & Maintenance:** Periodically review logs and update analysis rules to adapt to system changes.
*   **Utilize Visualization Tools:** Employ dashboards and graphs to make complex log data easily understandable.

Visual Layout: A central graphic representing a centralized log management system, with spokes leading to icons for each key point (e.g., a magnifying glass for baselines, a bell for alerting, a gear for maintenance, a graph for visualization). Use a clean, modern design with distinct color coding for each section.
