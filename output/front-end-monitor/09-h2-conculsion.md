You've got the roadmap—now it's time to act on it.

Frontend monitoring isn't optional anymore. Every second of delay costs you users, and every untracked error is money left on the table. The data backs this up: a [Google study](https://web.dev/rail/) found that 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than three seconds to load. That's half your potential customers gone before they even see your product.

Here's what you need to do next:

**Start small, measure what matters.** Pick three metrics from this guide—Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) are non-negotiable starting points. Set up basic **front end monitoring** with a free tier tool like Google Analytics 4 or Sentry's starter plan. You'll have actionable data within 24 hours.

**Choose your tool based on your team's reality.** If you're a solo developer or small team, start with an all-in-one platform like Datadog or New Relic. You need simplicity and speed. If you're managing 100k+ users or have specific pain points (like excessive JavaScript errors), add specialized tools like LogRocket or Hotjar to fill those gaps.

**Make monitoring a team habit, not a dashboard.** The best monitoring setup in the world is useless if no one checks it. Set up **automated alerts** for critical thresholds—LCP above 2.5 seconds, error rates spiking 20% above baseline, or JavaScript bundle sizes exceeding your budget. According to [Atlassian's incident management research](https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/common-metrics), teams that respond to alerts within 5 minutes see 60% faster resolution times.

**The bottleneck isn't the tool—it's the process.** Your monitoring strategy only works if it connects to action. Create a weekly review ritual: What slowed down this week? Which errors affected the most users? What patterns emerged? This 30-minute habit will catch issues before they become crises.

Remember this: **users don't care about your architecture.** They care that your app is fast, works every time, and doesn't frustrate them. Frontend monitoring gives you the visibility to deliver on that promise.

The competitive advantage goes to teams that ship fast *and* maintain quality. With the metrics, tools, and practices from this guide, you're equipped to do both.

Start monitoring today. Your users—and your bottom line—will thank you.
