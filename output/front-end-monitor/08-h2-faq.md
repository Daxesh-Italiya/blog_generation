**What is the difference between Real User Monitoring (RUM) and Synthetic Monitoring?**

Real User Monitoring tracks actual users as they interact with your application in real-time. It shows you what's really happening in production—slow loads in Australia, crashes on older Android devices, checkout failures on Safari. Synthetic Monitoring, on the other hand, uses automated scripts to simulate user journeys at scheduled intervals. Think of RUM as watching real customers shop in your store, while Synthetic is like sending a mystery shopper to check if the doors are unlocked and lights work. You need both. According to [Datadog's monitoring guide](https://www.datadoghq.com/knowledge-center/real-user-monitoring/), combining RUM and Synthetic gives you complete coverage—RUM for understanding actual user problems, Synthetic for catching issues before users encounter them.

**How do I implement frontend monitoring without slowing down my website?**

Load your monitoring script asynchronously so it doesn't block page rendering. Most modern front end monitoring tools like Sentry and LogRocket use this approach by default. Keep your sampling rate reasonable—you don't need to track every single user interaction to understand performance patterns. For example, start with 25% sampling for routine sessions and 100% for errors or slow page loads. The monitoring script itself typically adds less than 50ms to load time when implemented correctly. Use [Resource Hints](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/) like `dns-prefetch` and `preconnect` to speed up connections to your monitoring service's servers. And critically—defer initialization until after your core application loads. Your users should never wait for monitoring to start before they can interact with your app.

**Which frontend monitoring tool is best for a small startup with limited budget?**

For startups, **Sentry** offers the best value with a generous free tier (5,000 events/month) and transparent pricing as you scale. It covers error tracking, basic performance monitoring, and session replay for debugging. If you're already using other monitoring tools and just need front end application monitoring, consider [New Relic's free tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) which includes 100GB of data ingest monthly. For teams heavily focused on understanding user behavior and session replay, **LogRocket** starts at $99/month for 10,000 sessions. Avoid the temptation to use multiple specialized tools early on—you'll spend more time managing dashboards than fixing problems. Start with one comprehensive platform that handles errors and performance. You can always add specialized tools once you've validated what metrics actually matter for your specific application and user base.

**Can frontend monitoring tools track mobile app performance?**

Yes, but you'll need mobile-specific SDKs rather than the web JavaScript libraries. Tools like Sentry, Datadog, and New Relic offer native SDKs for iOS (Swift/Objective-C) and Android (Kotlin/Java) that track app crashes, API performance, screen load times, and user sessions. These SDKs handle mobile-specific metrics like battery drain, memory usage, and network conditions (WiFi vs. cellular). React Native and Flutter apps can use specialized monitoring that bridges native and JavaScript performance. The key difference: mobile monitoring captures device-specific data like OS version fragmentation and hardware variations that don't exist in web browsers. According to [Firebase's performance documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon), mobile monitoring should track startup time, screen rendering, and network requests as core metrics—these directly impact app store ratings and user retention.

**How do I choose between specialized tools vs. all-in-one platforms?**

Start with an all-in-one platform if you're building a team's monitoring practice from scratch. Tools like Datadog or New Relic reduce complexity—one dashboard, one vendor relationship, consistent data models across frontend and backend. You'll move faster when debugging issues that span your entire stack. Switch to specialized tools when you've identified specific gaps the platform can't fill. For example, add **Hotjar** if your all-in-one's heatmaps don't show enough user behavior detail, or **Sentry** if you need more sophisticated error grouping than your platform provides. The breaking point usually happens around 100k+ active users when specialized features (like LogRocket's pixel-perfect session replay or Honeycomb's distributed tracing) become worth the added complexity. Here's the test: if you're only using 30% of your all-in-one platform's features but paying for 100%, specialized tools will likely save money and give better results. But if you're constantly correlating data across tools, stick with the platform—context switching kills productivity more than missing features.
