### FAQ

**Q1: What is the primary goal of frontend monitoring?**

A1: The primary goal of frontend monitoring is to observe and optimize the user experience by tracking performance, availability, and errors directly from the user's browser. This helps ensure a fast, reliable, and smooth interaction with your web application.

**Q2: How does frontend monitoring differ from backend monitoring?**

A2: Backend monitoring focuses on server-side performance, database queries, API response times, and infrastructure health. Frontend monitoring, conversely, observes what happens after the server delivers content, including page load times, rendering performance, JavaScript errors, network requests made by the browser, and user interaction latency. Both are crucial for a complete picture of application health.
