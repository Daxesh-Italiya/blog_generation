You've made it through the technical maze of GCP Monitoring. **Here's the truth**: Most teams treat monitoring as an afterthought—they either overspend on logging everything or miss critical issues because they're not monitoring the right things. You now know how to avoid both mistakes.

The best monitoring setup isn't the one with the most metrics—it's the one that tells you **exactly what's broken, when it breaks, before your users notice**. Start with the basics: error rates, latency, and resource usage. Then layer on custom metrics that matter to *your* business. Use uptime checks for external validation, set up smart alerts that don't wake you up at 3 AM for nothing, and optimize your costs before GCP's billing surprises you.
